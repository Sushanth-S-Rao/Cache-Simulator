This is a project of Cache Simulator

It demonstrates how the computer access the memory through cache reference.
The address of the block in memory is places in cache using Direct Cache Mapping placement policy.
The address is divided into 3 parts; tag, set number, block offset - to determine where it will be stored in the Cache

Usage:    
Specify the input in the following format
./cache    [-hv]    -s    <s>    -E    <E>    -b    <b>    -t    <tracefile> 
-h:    Optional help ﬂag that prints usage info
-v:    Optional verbose ﬂag that displays trace info
-s    <s>:    Number of set index bits (S = 2^s is the number of sets) 
-E    <E>:    Associativity (number of lines per set)
-b    <b>:    Number of block bits (B = 2^b is the block size) 
-t    <tracefile>:  Name/Path of the memory trace

HIT is when the cache memory access is successful, that is the tag match and block is available
MISS is when the address isn't available in cache. The address is added to the cache
